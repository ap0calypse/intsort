What is intsort?
================

First of all: intsort was planned as a fast integer sorting algorithm, but with only 
little effort it could be ported to sort almost anything. This makes the name
intsort obolete, but I'll stick with it unless I find a better name.

It's not really good, but it's not very bad. Worst Case is O(n^2) which means, 
that if the last element in the list is the lowest one, 
we need n times n comparison operations. 

In the very special case, that the list is sorted or nearly sorted, the algorithm 
works pretty well. :P ....

How does it work?
=================

Let's assume you have the following unsorted array:

10,43,22,65,24,1,5

Intsort walks through the array and compares pair-wise:
10, 43

10 is lower than 43, next comparison:
43, 22

43 is bigger than 22, they swap places. Next pair:
43, 65

everything ok, next:
65, 24

they swap places again. Next step:
65, 1

1 is smaller, they swap, next:
65,5

they swap again. one loop complete. The array now looks like this:

10,22,43,24,1,5,65

This is not finished, so we run the loop again until there are no swaps anymore, which 
then means the array is sorted :)
